Search a value from the virtual memory on iOS.

## Resources
Other memory searching and writing tools I found
- https://github.com/stefanesser/dumpdecrypted
- https://github.com/BishopFox/bfdecrypt
- https://github.com/hexploitable/MEMSCAN
- https://github.com/PsychoBird/RevelariOS
- https://github.com/rainyx/rxmemscan
- https://github.com/MJx0/KittyMemory

Some of them only dump the memory but ultimately, they could achieve the same thing.

### Extra
[Mach IPC Interface](http://web.mit.edu/darwin/src/modules/xnu/osfmk/man/) has all you need for virtual memory.
