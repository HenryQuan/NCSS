# PvZ 2
PvZ is a game I played quite a lot and when PvZ 2 was released, it was amazing. Now, it is still great but too much microtransactions.

This game is chosen because of the binary size. 33Mb is quite large but I have seen 100Mb binaries before. 

## Performance
It was almost instant because the search is linear and returns early when the address is found. However, this may vary based on the device. A full scan takes about 200ms on my device which is fantastic.

## How to counter version update
My current strategy is based on a fixed hex string but this can be easily changed in a new version so I might need something else.
